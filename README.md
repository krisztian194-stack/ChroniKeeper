ChroniKeeper
"Consistency. Context. Continuity."

ChroniKeeper — much like SillyTavern — is an open-source front-end and simulation engine for managing and chatting with LLMs.

Where SillyTavern focuses on interface and interaction, ChroniKeeper extends that vision with a modular simulation core that maintains persistent character memory, coherent world environments, context-aware prompt generation, and stable cross-session continuity.

ChroniKeeper is designed to save users and developers from the endless maze of repetitive settings and fragmented tools that plague AI storytelling systems. It provides one cohesive, automated foundation to keep stories, characters, and worlds consistent — no matter how large or long the narrative becomes.

ChroniKeeper automatically manages interconnected systems that keep an AI-driven world alive and believable:

Character Engine – Tracks memory, mood, skills, relationships, and emotional decay with fuzzy human-like variance.
Environment Engine – Simulates time, weather, temperature, moon cycles, and comfort levels dynamically.
World Core – Grid-based map with zones, comfort, noise, and landmark persistence.
Prompt Core – Generates localized, LLM-friendly prompts for consistent storytelling.
NPC Manager – Handles background logic for non-player characters, schedules, and relationship states.
Web Core – FastAPI-based diagnostic dashboard with live simulation state and prompt preview.

ChroniKeeper integrates seamlessly with local or hosted LLMs, acting as both a logic controller and a continuity anchor for your AI-driven experiences.

Every LLM project eventually reinvents memory, time, and consistency. ChroniKeeper does it once — and does it right.

ChroniKeeper provides structure against configuration drift in LLM world setups. It gives storytellers, modders, and worldbuilders a flexible backbone that preserves personality continuity, manages world logic automatically, reduces prompt bloat, and keeps stories grounded in consistent states.

ChroniKeeper is not just another memory plugin — it’s the missing simulation layer every AI storytelling system needs.
